# calculator--py
Basic calculator, beginner Python project 
(Written in Python 3)

## How to use
## Multi Liners
Just choose your first number, press enter. Choose your second number, press enter. Choose what you want to do with the two, press enter. Done.

## One Liners
Just put your basic math problem in the first question in one line as such: >>> 4 + 5

Note: Spaces are required. Keep it basic, something such as 5 + 5 + 5 will return 10 since only the first and last number will be added. No unnecessary spaces.
